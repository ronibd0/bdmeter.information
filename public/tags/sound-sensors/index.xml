      <description>Introduction: If some time ago textile materials were considered good sound insulators, their present programmability is about to change their definition, transforming them into musical instruments and tools of sound measurement and visualization. By comparison to the analogue world, the notions of texture and touch are gaining new connotations, while the new textures and ‘smart gestures’ are introducing a new expressivity. Following a series of inquiries in physical computing, the present text will present a series of new configurations between texture, touch and sound and the connections between them in both analogue and digital environments.</description>

      <description>This article will help you understand and become familiar with other sensors that play a very important part in process control, but may not be encountered on a daily basis. The following are covered in this chapter:
■ Position, distance, velocity, and acceleration sensors
■ Rotation sensors using light and Hall effect sensors
■ Force, torque, load cells, and balances
■ Smoke detectors, gas, and chemical sensors in the industry</description>
