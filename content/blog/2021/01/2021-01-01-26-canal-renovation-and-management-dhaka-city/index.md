The capital's city enterprises yesterday officially assumed control over the administration and support obligations of 26 channels and 10 kilometres of box ducts from Dhaka Wasa, raising expectation that the city's long-standing water logging issue would be addressed.

Dhaka Water Supply and Sewerage Authority (Wasa) had been answerable for the 26 trenches (84.5km) and the 10 box ducts (around 10km) since 1988. It additionally takes care of 385km of tempest water waste.

The DNCC and DSCC have been overseeing 2,200km of line and surface channels.

CEO ABM Amin Ullah Nuri of Dhaka South City Corporation (DSCC), his Dhaka North City Corporation (DNCC) partner Md Selim Reza, and Managing Director of Dhaka Wasa Taqsem A Khan marked a MoU in the interest of their associations at a city lodging yesterday.

LGRD Minister Md Tazul Islam at the function stated, "From today the two city companies will have the duties of taking care of the waterlogging issue of Dhaka city and they should accomplish the work taking assistance from different organizations and inhabitants of Dhaka city."

He said they had held a gathering on the issue a month ago and framed a specialized advisory group.

With the board's proposals and the leader's endorsement, Wasa gave over the trenches and waste framework alongside the vital labor, hardware, and specialized archives.

Tazul said many water bodies in Dhaka city had been infringed upon and involved, even by the public authority. The city companies with the assistance of public delegates would find a way to recuperate them.

"We need to save the water bodies from the encroaches in stages," he said.

Tazul said they were getting ready activities to fabricate walkways along the waterways and water bodies and to encourage water transport.

DSCC Mayor Sheik Fazle Noor Taposh said they would fire tidying up of three trenches - Jirani, Manda, Syampur - and two box courses in Panthapath and Segunbagicha from tomorrow.

"We will proceed with the tidy up work until March and we will do likewise for different waterways like Kalunagar and old Buriganga channel and Dholaikhal box course by June," he said.

Taposh said they would not sit tight for the public authority reserves and would accomplish the work with their own cash.

"We will define up limit columns, eliminate all encroaches and secure the recuperated land.

"We will likewise make strides so the trenches are not topped off with trash once more," he said.

Taposh said they would take measures to associate all the channels and in the event that they succeed, Dhaka would be as excellent as Venice.

"We simply need to keep the trenches clean, increment availability, and accomplish the upkeep work appropriately," he said.

DNCC Mayor Md Atiqul Islam said there were more than 100 trenches in Dhaka city and the vast majority of them have just vanished. He said the city would not have any water logging if all the trenches were there.

He stated, "As indicated by specialists, 25 percent open space and 12 percent water bodies are required in a city. We have much not exactly the required."

The city hall leader said they need to organize a water transport framework and make more water maintenance zones.

"We need to differentiate all the waterways through city review, remove all encroaches from the trenches and increment water helping limit of the channels through unearthing."

Mentioning the LGRD clergyman to make essential strides, Atiqul proposed constructing raised streets on the eastern finish of Dhaka rather than flood insurance bank that had been done on the western end.

Joint Secretary Iqbal Habib of Bangladesh Poribesh Andolon said despite the fact that the two city partnerships have assumed liability of the trenches, they didn't turn into their overseers with full power. The delegate chief's office stays as their caretakers.

He, be that as it may, said the city enterprises do have the ability to direct expulsion drives.

As civic chairmen and councilors are public delegates, they would have the option to recuperate the water bodies guaranteeing public help, which would be compelling, he said.
