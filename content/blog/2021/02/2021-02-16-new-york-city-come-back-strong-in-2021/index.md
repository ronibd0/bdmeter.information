Open culture for all : New Yorkers

New York City Mayor Gonzalo Casals Said: "Open culture is another steps towards our recovery for our city. We are launching 115 street locations in all five boroughs and it brings stages to our neighborhoods and culture to the heart of our neighbors and give artists, cultural institutions and creatives to place to showcase their talents as they recover from the pandemic.

American cultural community is their conscience, their hope and identity as the New Yorkers.
