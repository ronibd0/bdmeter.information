What is Human Trafficking & Forced Labor?  
Employees are in vulnerable state (cannot pay back loans, debts, cannot provide for his/her family, forced to stay in employment longer than expected)  
Employees pay unlawful fees (transportation, recruitment, medical tests, uncertain training), taxes, deposits and/or bonds charged for the purpose of recruitment or employment/ as a condition of employment  
Employees receive threats of terminations and/or repatriations (e.g. threats of repatriation for foreign workers or sending back home of migrant workers)  
Human trafficking results in forced, bonded, indentured labor & sexual exploitation

The illegal trade of human beings for the purposes of exploitation, forced labor and slavery

Uncertain training: some brokers in labor-exporting countries charge high fees for training migrant workers (basic language, job skill, social manner) before they sent them to the destination country.  
Q&As

- Can you think of examples of forced labor?

How big is the problem?

2,45 million people worldwide are trafficked & forced to work.

40% of people are being forced to work, which is a 10% increase compared to the 2007-2010 period.  
33% of detected victims are children, which is a 5% increase compared to the 2007-2010 period.

Countries At High Risk of Human Trafficking  
Not fully compliant but making significant efforts  
Not fully compliant but making significant efforts:  
number of victims very significant or increasing  
failed to provide evidence of efforts  
commitments by country for future steps  
Do not fully comply with the minimum standards and are not making significant efforts to do so

Q&As

- Where is your country listed under?

Common Issues  
Severe debt (debt bondage, peonage) due to illegal recruitment  
No legally required employee custody of original documents (e.g. passport, work permit, birth certification, official ID card, driver's license, family record book)  
Restrictions from resigning employment through threats, debts, deposits or other abusive means  
Unlawful deposit requirements - Deposits above 20% of 1 month's basic salary  
Wage withholding for more than two pay periods  
Unlawful mandatory overtime  
Mandatory overtime beyond legal overtime limits in written policy  
Mandatory overtime under the menace of penalty (e.g. abuse, financial penalties, loss of privileges)  
Monetary deductions resulting from unlawful disciplinary actions  
Monetary deposits for items not mandated by law or agreement (PPE, uniforms, tools etc.)

Q&As  
Can you describe how can a worker get into severe debt, in case of human trafficking?  
From time of recruitment, hiring, and employment practices.

Problem of reporting  
They do not want to jeopardize that job by exposing how they got it.  
They may be in a country illegally and liable to (or afraid of) prosecution themselves.  
The criminals involved make sure that the threat of sanctions is strong enough to deter exposure.

The victims of forced labor and modern slavery are usually reluctant to come forward because there is little benefit for them in reporting the crime.  
Q&As  
Can you think of ways to encourage the workers to come forward in case of forced labor?  
Does your factory have any grievance mechanisms? Do you know details?

What does the Law say?  
Local laws

What does the Law say?  
International laws  
The ILO’s Forced Labour Convention (No. 29) of 1930 defines forced labor as, “all work or service which is exacted from any person under the menace of any penalty and for which the said person has not offered himself voluntarily.” The Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery, the Slave Trade, and Institutions and Practices Similar to Slavery, adopted in 1956, defines debt bondage as “the status or condition arising from a pledge by a debtor of his personal services or of those of a person under his control as security for a debt, if the value of those services as reasonably assessed is not applied towards the liquidation of the debt of the length and nature of those services are not respectively limited and defined.”

California Transparency Supply Chains Act of 2010 (SB 657)  
Modern Slavery Act of 2015 (UK law)

Q&As  
What is slavery?  
Is it legal in your country? Or any country?

California Transparency Supply Chains Act of 2010 (SB 657)  
Retailers and manufacturers must disclose on their website, by Jan 1, 2012, the extent that they have done the following related to human trafficking & slavery in their supply chain:

Assess, verify and address risks and identify if the verification is not conducted by a third party.  
Audit suppliers to assess compliance to the company’s standards and identify if the verification did not involve an independent, unannounced audit.  
Require direct suppliers to certify that materials incorporated into their products comply with the relevant laws of the countries in which they are doing business.  
Maintain internal accountability standards and procedures for employees or contractors that do not meet the company’s standards.  
Provide training on human trafficking & slavery and how to mitigate related risks, to employees and management who have direct responsibility for supply chain management.

Q&As  
Does your factory have to disclose whether they traffic people?  
To whom?

Modern Slavery Act of 2015 (UK law)  
The act is designed to tackle slavery in the UK and consolidates the current offences relating to trafficking and slavery.  
Criminals found guilty will be arrested and prosecuted. 

The act contains a number of provisions:

A commercial organization must prepare a slavery and human trafficking statement for each financial year of the organization.  
A slavery and human trafficking statement for a financial year is a statement of the steps the organization has taken during the financial year to ensure that slavery and human trafficking is not taking place in any of its supply chains, and in any part of its own business, or a statement that the organization has taken no such steps.  
An organization's slavery and human trafficking statement may include information about—  
(a) the organization's structure, its business and its supply chains;  
(b) its policies in relation to slavery and human trafficking;  
(c) its due diligence processes in relation to slavery and human trafficking in its business and supply chains;  
(d) the parts of its business and supply chains where there is a risk of slavery and human trafficking taking place, and the steps it has taken to assess and manage that risk;  
(e) its effectiveness in ensuring that slavery and human trafficking is not taking place in its business or supply chains, measured against such performance indicators as it considers appropriate;  
(f) the training about slavery and human trafficking available to its staff.

4. Duties maybe imposed on commercial organizations due to this are enforceable by the Secretary of State bringing civil proceedings in the High Court for an injunction or, in Scotland, for specific performance of a statutory duty under section 45 of the Court of Session Act 1988.

Effective October 2015  
all commercial organizations carrying on business in UK with a total turnover of GBP36m or more must publicly report on the steps they have taken to ensure their supply chains and business operations are human trafficking and slavery free.

Forced, bonded, indentured, slave and prison labor are prohibited.

No employee shall be in debt due to recruitment or employment. No employee shall be subject to any illegal deposits or deposits of more than 20% of one month’s wages. Suppliers shall not withhold wages for more than two pay periods.  
Employees shall maintain custody and/or have free access to personal identity documents, must be guaranteed freedom of movement, and shall not be restricted from terminating employment (other than restrictions pertaining to legal notice periods).  
Suppliers shall abide by all applicable laws on mandatory overtime. Mandatory overtime (if legally permitted) shall be within legal overtime limits in policy and in practice. Mandatory overtime shall not be implemented under the menace of penalty and employees shall provide written consent to mandatory overtime requirements prior to employment or overtime.  
Suppliers shall not utilize prison laborers in its production processes, neither within nor outside a prison facility.  
Use standards as example  
Prevention

Prevent non-compliances by setting up strong policies for forced, bonded and indentured labor

All hiring and termination practices meet or exceed legal requirements. Suppliers impose strict recruitment practices to mitigate the risk of trafficking in persons  
Suppliers shall use registered or licensed recruitment agencies when recruiting migrant (domestic and foreign) employees.  
Suppliers shall classify employees and provide terms of employment, as required by law. Employees shall be aware of their employment terms and provided with a copy of the labor contract, in a language understood by the employee. Employees shall not be required to sign an incomplete labor contract.  
Terms of employment promised to the employee during recruitment and hire shall meet the actual terms of employment.  
Employees shall be free from paying fees (e.g., fees for transportation, recruitment, and medical tests), taxes, deposits and/or bonds charged for the purpose of recruitment or employment or as a condition of employment. Employees shall not be indebted due to the recruitment or hiring process and, thus, be able to freely terminate employment.  
Suppliers shall not use illegal recruitment and hiring tests for the purpose of recruitment or employment or as a condition of employment. Suppliers shall not test for pregnancy or HIV unless permitted by local law. Employees shall be hired and maintained in employment regardless of pregnancy or marital status.  
Suppliers shall request original, legal documentation to verify the employees’ age at the time of hire and eligibility to work, and maintain documentation or copies of documentation to demonstrate due diligence.  
Employee probation periods shall be in compliance with the law. Suppliers shall not illegally terminate employees and shall maintain termination records, as required by law, and at minimum for the past 12 months.  
Employees shall be free from threats of termination and/or repatriation.
