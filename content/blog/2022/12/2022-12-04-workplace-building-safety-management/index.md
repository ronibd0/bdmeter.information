This content will help Engineers, and architects learn about industrial or, warehouse building safety management and help to achieve certificates easily. It’s not easy to get building certificates and this article will help us to know about the step-by-step process to implement building safety in our own business zone and apply to achieve international certificates.

## Evacuation map

### **In case of emergency:**

- Don't panic

- Leave the building in CALM by the nearest exit

- USE STAIRWAY for the exit, do not use the elevator

- DO NOT stop to collect belongings

- Report to ASSEMBLY POINT at parking yard of Ground Floor

- DO NOT return to the building until the building was declared safe

### Classification of Issues

| Categories | Issues/Terms |
| --- | --- |
| A – Minor | • Lower Risk  
• Approved to begin/continue business  
• Suppliers are requested to correct, reduce or eliminate these issues. |
| B – Major | • Medium Risk  
• Conditionally Approved  
• Remediation is required within 12 months from the time of discovery of issues.  
• Repeated failure to act to correct these issues will result in the termination of the business relationship with the customer. |
| **C – Critical** | **• High Risk  
• Conditionally Approved  
• Remediation is required within 6 months from the time of discovery of  
issues.  
• Repeated failure to act to correct these issues will result in the termination  
of the business relationship with the customer.** |
| **D - Zero Tolerance** | **• Extremely High Risk - Egregious and unacceptable to the company and its customers.

## ME015: Inadequate fire alert system

### Customer code standard

• Suppliers shall ensure the installation of adequate, appropriate, and easily accessible fire prevention and firefighting equipment (e.g. fire alert system) at high-risk workplaces including materials or finished goods warehouse, as required by applicable law and regulations.

![](images/Screenshot-from-2022-12-04-15-22-26.png)

• There should be regular inspection and maintenance of the fire alert system (e.g. siren, PA, voice alarm systems, or strobe light) installed in the factory buildings with records maintained.

![](images/Screenshot-from-2022-12-04-15-22-41.png)

• Fire control facilities and equipment should be tested regularly as required. For example, the siren, PA, etc., should be tested monthly.

![](images/Screenshot-from-2022-12-04-15-22-50-1.png)

• Every building and site should have a set of effective systems to alert employees.

• Small factory buildings may only require relatively simple alert systems (e.g., siren, PA or strobe light), whereas large sites or buildings with multiple floors may require complex multi-station, multi-zoned systems.

![](images/Screenshot-from-2022-12-04-15-27-14.png)

![](images/Screenshot-from-2022-12-04-15-27-04.png)

## ZE005: Immediate fire hazard from unsafe chemical management

### Customer Code Standard

• Suppliers shall ensure policy, procedures, and all necessary controls are in place for the  
management, storage, dispensing, and transportation of all combustible, flammable and explosive  
materials according to the law, in order to minimize the potential for fire impacts.

• All combustible, flammable, and explosive chemicals or materials should be stored in a designated  
area, which is well-ventilated, spark-proof, equipped with sufficient fire-fighting equipment, away from  
direct sunlight and heat, ignition sources and pressure relief valves, electrostatic discharge proof, and  
protected from leaks.

• Explosion-proof equipment and lighting should be used in areas where flammable or combustible  
materials are stored.

• Smoking near the area of flammable and combustible materials is strictly prohibited. "No Smoking"  
signs must be posted where appropriate and "No Smoking" rules must be enforced in areas where  
flammable or combustible materials are used or stored. Smoking should only be allowed in  
designated safe areas that are far from restricted areas.

### The importance of compliance

• Many workplace fires have been caused by careless behavior involving chemical hazards such as combustible, flammable, or explosive materials.

![](images/Screenshot-from-2022-12-04-15-40-56-1024x272.png)

• Flammable/combustible materials must be stored in purpose-built, designated areas.

### Customer Code Standard

<table><tbody><tr><td>• Suppliers shall ensure suitable control<br>measures are in place to prevent<br>exposure to electrical fires according to<br>the law. Electrical plugs, cords, and wiring<br>should be maintained to ensure proper<br>insulation, no exposed wiring, without<br>frays, and operated within legal limits.</td><td><img class="wp-image-3476" style="width: 250px;" src="images/Screenshot-from-2022-12-04-16-14-19.png" alt=""></td></tr><tr><td>• All electrical distribution panels, breakers,<br>switches and junction boxes should be<br>completely enclosed and protected from<br>wet conditions to eliminate the immediate<br>fire hazard.</td><td><img class="wp-image-3477" style="width: 250px;" src="images/Screenshot-from-2022-12-04-16-14-28.png" alt=""></td></tr></tbody></table>

Table: unsafe electrical conditions

### The importance of compliance :

Many fires are caused by situations involving electrical hazards, including when:

• electrical wiring, plugs, and sockets are in poor condition

• extension cords and power tools are worn or damaged

• electrical outlets are overloaded through use by numerous electrical appliances

• electrical switchboards, electrical wiring or extension cords are located or used under wet conditions

• electrical work and regular maintenance are not conducted by a qualified technician or a licensed electrician

• unsafe equipment is used that may have exposed live parts, lack earthing/grounding protection, or have substandard wiring/connections, especially for electrical plugs

### The importance of compliance ( continued ) :

<table><tbody><tr><td>• Fire frequently results from excessive heat that is<br>produced by above-normal resistance in wiring and,<br>more commonly, at connection points.</td><td><img class="wp-image-3480" style="width: 250px;" src="images/Screenshot-from-2022-12-04-16-18-08.png" alt=""></td></tr><tr><td>• Fire hazards can be minimized through a<br>combination of proper installation techniques,<br>utilization of proper standard equipment, installation<br>of proper protection devices, and ongoing adequate<br>maintenance of electrical systems and equipment.</td><td><img class="wp-image-3479" style="width: 250px;" src="images/Screenshot-from-2022-12-04-16-18-16.png" alt=""></td></tr><tr><td>• It is the responsibility of the Electrical<br>Supervisor to conduct an electrical risk<br>assessment and electrical safety<br>inspection at least annually to identify<br>electrical hazards</td><td><img class="wp-image-3478" style="width: 250px;" src="images/Screenshot-from-2022-12-04-16-18-27.png" alt=""></td></tr></tbody></table>
