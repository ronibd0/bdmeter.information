## Steps for Process-related Risk Assessment

1. Understand the process flow on how to manufacture the product

3. Identify the hazards from its process step (task)

5. Decide who might be harmed and how

7. Evaluate the risks and decide on precaution

9. Record your findings and implement them

11. Review your assessment and update if necessary
