## Plastic Toys production process: Common EHS Hazards

| Process | Common EHS Hazards | Recommendation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1\. Raw materials storage  
(mainly plastic resin)  
 | Exposure of hazardous works affecting the occupational health of employees - skin sensitizing exposure of plastic resins (if uncured resins) after prolonged contact from the inventory of raw materials storage (HS001) | Regular medical surveillance for employees who are exposed to hazardous work (i.e., skin / respiratory contact of plastic resins (if uncured resins) from the inventory of raw materials storage) at the factory's expense. (HS001-CM001)  
Hazardous source control by engineering methods - e.g., good ventilation in the raw materials storage area as prolonged skin sensitizing contact of a lot of plastic resins (if uncured resins) during incoming / transferring raw material bags from off-site for further production and administration measures - e.g., job rotation/shift work to reduce the exposure time of the hazardous working environment – uncured resin (in conjunction with many solvents) environment (HS001-CM002)  
Provision and use of proper PPE (i.e., protective clothing, dust filtering face mask & safety goggles for skin/respiratory hazard) but do not just depend on it – remove exposure first (HS001-CM003). |
