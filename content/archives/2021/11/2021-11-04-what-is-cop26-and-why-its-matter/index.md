## Why does COP26 is matter?

Most people considered that climate changes are the main reason for the current situation of the world. Most of us is thinking that the Cvid-19 outbreaks happened due to the huge global pollution, and vast climate changes, continuity of toxic Carbon emissions, Methane gas emission, seawater pollution, increasing polyethylene usage, manufacturing and disposes of, all those impacts on global temperature has been increasing more rapidly. These changes impact our environment, animals, crops, trees as well as their threat to the existence of mankind.

## What Scientists are saying?

Now we are here with COP26, to ask the scientists what should we do, how general people can contribute to saving our future, how to lead a lifestyle to invest our own efforts to build our future... Maybe we can expect some comments, let's hope...
