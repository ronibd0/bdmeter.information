## Goal Setting & Cascading

**Purpose  
**Goal setting is a powerful tool that is used to align the team and individual goals to  
Operating Group objectives and strategies. This strategy keeps all levels of the  
organization on the same page. It not only helps improve the attainment of the 3- Year  
Plan strategy but also encourages on-going communication between employees and  
their managers. As well, each individual can see how their job makes a difference in the  
overall success of the business. - All of these means **[Performance Management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_management)**

**Process**  
Each individual is requested to develop 3-5 goals around four perspectives namely  
Business, Customer, Operations and People. Senior management starts off setting the  
goals for the entire business and cascading down the line.  
To prepare for individual goals, one must review the immediate manager’s goal first and  
link to own job role in deciding what can be accomplished in their role. The manager  
can also assign goals to his/her team or individual. Both the manager and the employee  
need to be involved in the goal setting. Together they need to agree on goals that are  
demanding yet achievable.  
The requirement is to set 3-5 goals but it is not necessary to have one goal in each  
perspective. It all depends on the role of the individual.

**Business** – strategic initiatives that lead to “**[financial goals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_finance#Personal_financial_planning_process)**”  
**Customer** – quality of products and services, delivery effectiveness that lead to  
customer satisfaction  
**Operations** – internal processes that lead to cost efficiency or effectiveness  
**People** – quantity and quality of employees that lead to personal, team and organization  
growth

### Goal Alignment

Goal alignment involves ensuring that both people from top to bottom in an  
organization, are working to achieve similar goals.  
First, we want people, from the top to the bottom, to contribute to the achievement of  
the same set of goals that are important to the success of the entire organization. We  
also want everyone to understand how their own individual contributions contribute to  
the attainment of organizational goals  
We want people to be pulling in the same direction within an organization results in  
higher productivity and speed-up attainment of organization goals.  
The following is an example of how goals are cascaded down the line based on the  
organization strategic focus.

## S.M.A.R.T Goals

The concept of writing [S.M.A.R.T. goals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria) is very important for accomplishing individual  
goals, which in turn are linked to Operating Group Goals. The following will assist you in  
creating S.M.A.R.T. goals.  
Specific: A specific goal usually answers the five “W” questions:  
• What: What do I want to accomplish?  
• Why: Specific reasons, purpose or benefits of accomplishing the goal.  
• Who: Who is involved?  
• Where: Identify a location.  
• Which: Identify requirements and constraints.  
E.g. “By Nov 1, 2015, implement a new performance management system for all levels  
using clearly defined processes and guidelines so employees and managers can  
evaluate performance objectively and develop their careers”

Measurable: A measurable goal will usually answer questions such as:  
• How much?  
• How many?  
• How will I know when it is accomplished?

Actionable: An actionable goal involves thinking through what knowledge, skills and  
abilities, resources needed to achieve the goal. It will usually answer the question:  
• How: How can the goal be accomplished?  
Relevant: This stresses the importance of choosing goals that matter. A goal that  
supports or is in alignment with your manager or other goals would be considered a  
relevant goal. A relevant goal can answer yes to these questions:  
• Does this link to the three- year plan strategy and direction?  
• Does this match our stream/ function efforts and needs?  
• Is this somewhat aligned with my manager goals?

Timely: Give the goals a target date. Establish a sense of urgency. A time-bound goal  
will usually answer the question:  
• When?  
• What can I do 6 months from now?  
• What can I do 6 weeks from now?  
• What can I do today?  

## Goal Evaluation Rating

The rating scale is designed for reviewers to differentiate level of performance in a fair  
and objective manner. The given rating should be evidence-based which means that  
individual has to submit the results achieved in quantifiable and qualitative terms  
before the year –end review starts.  
It is recommended that individual list the accomplishments in relation to the goals set.  
Back this up with specific examples, targets achieved in quantifiable terms. Continue by  
listing examples of activities that supported the progress toward achieving the goals,  
even if you didn’t meet them. Incorporate the notes into the system and submit to  
immediate manager for review.

## Score Goal Rating Description

Too New to Rate Less than 3 months in the position  
Does not meet expectations Significantly below target  
Partially meets expectations Target not fully achieved  
Meets expectations Target fully achieved  
Exceeds expectations Significantly exceeded target

### COMPETENCIES

Competency is a set of related abilities, knowledge, skills that enable a person or an  
organization to perform effectively in a job and achievement of goals. Each level of  
responsibility has its own requirements and individual can compare own proficiency  
level to the requirements at any stage of his or her career.  
Using Competencies in Performance Management  
Provides consistency in establishing performance expectations and measuring  
actual performance  
Uses in individual development plans to target gaps and identify development  
opportunities  
Helps identify exceptional individuals that have had a significant contribution to  
organizational success  
Provides feedback to individuals to move them toward exemplary performance

### Competencies Framework

There are two sets of competencies namely Core and Leadership Competencies. Core  
Competencies are knowledge, skills and behaviors that can apply to all or most jobs or  
specific positions in the organization. And, for Leadership Competencies are skills,  
capabilities and behaviors that are critical to current and future role of a leader in achieving our strategic plans.  
Core Competencies for Grade 4 and below :  
1) Communication  
2) Customer Focus  
3) Job Knowledge / Technical Knowledge  
4) Results Orientation  
5) Teamwork and collaboration  
6) Execute Seamlessly  
7) Innovation  

**Leadership Competencies for Grade 3 and above:**

1) Think Strategically  
2) Customer Focus  
3) Lead Courageously  
4) Engage Others  
5) Execute Seamlessly  
6) Promote Innovation  
7) Develop people  
8) Influence and Collaborate  
9) Build Community  

**Each of the above competencies has the following components:  
Competency** - is the title or name of the core competency. For example: Communication  
**Competency Descriptor** \- is the definition or descriptor statement explaining what the  
core competency means. For example: Communication is described as - the way you  
communicate ideas and information ensuring your message is understood.  
**Behavioral Indicators** \- are examples that indicate how an individual could  
demonstrate that competency. Behavior indicators are designed to show what effective  
performance looks like, it is not an exhaustive list. For example: some of the behavioral  
indicators for communicating with others are - actively listens to people / speaks clearly  
and concisely / can write in a way that is meaningful to the reader / uses jargon free  
language and so on.  
The Behavioral Indicators description are written based on levels required for a given  
role or situation, allowing us to clearly focus our discussions and development efforts  
for the greatest improvement in performance.  
Please see appendix for the two sets of competencies and the expected behaviors at  
each level.  

## Competencies Evaluation Rating

The rating scale is designed for reviewers to differentiate level of performance in a fair  
and objective manner. The given rating should be evidence-based which means that  
individual has to provide examples on how the employee met or did not meet the  
required expectations.  
Ask the following questions to prevent subjective impressions:  
1) Any behavioral examples identified for that particular competency?  
2) What are the quality and consistency of the behavioral examples obtained?  
3) To what degree has the individual had a chance to demonstrate behavior  
relative to the competency?  

**Competencies Rating Description  
**Too New to Rate Less than 3 months in position  
Does not meet expectations Did not demonstrate expected behaviors  
and need intensive development  
Partially meets expectations Occasionally demonstrated some of the  
expected behaviors  
Meets expectations Demonstrated proficiency in the expected  
behaviors at a satisfactory level  
Exceeds expectations Exceeded expected behavior. Serves as role  
model  

## Year-end Review & Discussion

**Purpose  
**Year end review formalizes the ongoing performance management process and  
provides the opportunity to recognize employee’s accomplishments and contributions,  
give feedback on performance, and plan for development and improvement. Therefore,  
make the process meaningful by getting it done right and on time.  
The review of past year’s performance will be consisted of two parts: assessment on the  
results achieved (i.e. goal achievement) and individual’s behaviors displayed during the  
process of achieving the results (i.e. competency assessment).  
**Process  
**Year end review takes place in December every year. Here’s the recommended process:  
1) **Employee provides self-evaluation** \- Employee reviews his or her goals  
accomplishment for the past year and completes the competencies rating in the  
MyCareer Platform  
2) **Manager prepares for the review**\- The manager collects performance data and/or talk  
to people who are within or outside the team to get feedback on the employee’s  
performance  
3) **Manager reviews the employee self**\-evaluation and adds own views – The manager  
receives system notification of the completed self-evaluation. Reviews and adds in own  
views and examples. Rates the goals and competencies section. Thinks through the  
development needs of the employee with some ideas on development options  
4) **Conducts the year-end conversation** – Sets up a time to meet and discuss all sections  
of the performance evaluation in the MyCareer Platform. Below are some ideas for the  
discussion:  

**The employee should be given the opportunity to  
**o describe the results against each objective and other projects  
o review own strengths and areas of improvement  
o development needs  
The manager should also share his or her views on  
o the goal, competencies and final rating  
o the employee’s strengths and areas of improvement  
o development needs and possible development options  
o possibilities of career path ( if appropriate)  
Conducts a quick retention chat along with the performance discussion. For example,  
simply asks how the employee perceives his/ her work environment and how  
challenged or satisfied with the work  
  
5) **Completes the final version by both manager and employee** – After the meeting,  
the manager incorporates all points raised in the conversation and completes the  
year-end evaluation form and sends back to employee for acknowledgement  
the employee completes the development planning section ready

## Overall Performance Rating

The overall performance rating is composed of Goals and Competencies Evaluation.  
The MyCareer Platform will generate an average goal rating based on the 3-5 goals and  
the average competencies rating based on the 7-9 competencies. The two sets of rating  
will be seen as independent results. There is no calculated overall rating.  
The manager is required to give the overall rating based on the following scale.  

**Overall Performance

## Performance Development Planning

**Purpose**  
The Performance Development Planning process enables you and the people who  
report to you to identify their personal and business development needs that are most  
significant to the organization’s success. Only through a disciplined goal setting and  
communication process will bring individual and organization capability from strength  
to strength.  
PDP meetings are held, at least, bi-annually to review the person’s progress on the  
action plan of the development goals. This meeting allows you to offer/ seek assistance  
and to identify any help individual needs to succeed.  
It is the individual takes responsibility in own personal development. The 4- step  
approach mentioned below tells us how.  
**Process**  
**A 4- Step Approach  
**1). **Planning**. Employee identifies types of development needs. A) Performance  
problems- what are the performance gaps and is it a result of skill deficit or attitudinal  
problem B) Opportunities – is the gap a result of lack of experience and exposure to  
complex issues C) Enhancement opportunities – Competencies related to current or  
future role.  
Discusses with manager what alternate patterns of behavior should be worked on and  
manager provides suggestions if the employee has difficulty coming up with  
development options.  
2). **Discussion**. Employee sets up time with manager to share development needs, get  
feedback and employees complete their own personal development plan (PDP).  
3). **Take Action**. Employee sets development goal and explores the  
appropriate development options (see overleaf for the various options and definition)  
Consider the 70-20-10 learning and development approach. Takes consideration of  
resources in terms of who can support the plan and works on it accordingly.  
4). **Check** in. Employee meets with manager regularly to follow up on progress and  
updates the system. Gets feedback on performance from other parties e.g. superior,  
peers and/or subordinates.  

### Development Options

Most development actions tend to be around training only. It is important to take the  
other options into consideration, as training is a quick fix and easy option to implement,  
but not always the most effective on its own. This guide provides managers and all  
colleagues with information to help them select the most appropriate development  
activities that meet their needs. The emphasis in this Guide is non-course-based option.  
The course-based programme can be found on the new Learning Management System.

**70-20-10 Principle in Learning  
**The concept states that development typically begins with realization of a need and  
motivation to do something about it, and that a blend of different learning approaches  
can provide powerful learning.  
• about 70% of learning is provided through on-the-job experiences and use of  
challenging assignment or tasks,  
• about 20% of learning is developed through relationships, networks,  
observations and feedback – social learning  
• about 10% of the learning through formal training processes and reading  
70% On-the-Job experiences  
  
There are different experiences that allow the leaders and managers to learn leadership  
skills in managing direct reports, becoming self-aware and better at executing  
effectively. Such experiences include:  
• Take up job turnarounds  
• Increase job scopes  
• Make horizontal moves  
• Lead new initiatives  
• Job secondment  

While some of the above job experiences may provide new skills for leadership job  
positions, there are other forms of experience that are relevant for broader positions,  
such as:  
• Provide new challenges  
• Participate in cross-functional meeting  
• Train new team members  
• Teach new skills and process to other team members  
• Expand job roles and responsibilities  
• Learn through working special projects  
• Assign to a cross-functional project  
• Fill in for a manager in vacation  
• Plan special events  
• Develop a successor or high potential employee  
• Complete a total new task not done before  
• Conduct presentations to senior management  
20% Social Learning – Learning Through Others  
Thus social learning may be done face-to-face or through the use of internet. Some of  
the methods used include:  
• Coaching  
• Mentoring- Find a mentor or be a mentor  
• Networking  
• Shadowing a skilled performer  
• Participate in discussion or interest groups  
• Seek advice and opinions  
• Get feedback from others  
• Ask an expert  

**10% Formal Learning – Courses and Reading  
**Although training is seen as contributing just 10% of a person’s development plan in  
the 70-20-10 model, the formal training courses clarify, support and boost the other  
90% of the person’s learning. That is, the training gives the learners the basic building  
blocks on which the other forms of learning can be built. Some of the examples are:  
• Attend a formal class  
• Participate in e-Learning modules  
• On-line research  
• Executive Education  
• Read a book  
• Read an article  

### Descriptions of Different Development Options

**Mentoring**  
Mentoring involves a mentor, who provides advice and support to someone else who  
wants to develop their own potential. It can be very useful to have someone  
knowledgeable about your work context that can help you think things through.  
Individuals may find it particularly helpful to have a mentor when he/she is at critical  
points of career development. The sharing of experience, skills and ideas from mentor  
to mentee is the most valuable.  

**Coaching**  
Coaching is a process in which an individual, through discussion and guided activity,  
helps a colleague to solve a problem or achieve an objective that is personally important  
to the individual. It can be very useful when an individual would like to gain a mastery  
of certain areas, understand more of own strengths and areas of improvement, have a  
coach to support the execution of a major goal, etc.

**Discussion/ Interest Groups  
**Get together with a group of individuals who share a common interest or learning  
needs. The group is self-organized to meet periodically with the intention of sharing  
knowledge. This is a source of peer support and sharing of best practice and stimulating  
new ideas. It can be useful if an individual want to gain more experience at working and  
leading small groups and building problem solving skills. The discussion form can be  
face-to-face or participate in virtual communities.

**On- the Job Experiences  
**On-the-Job Training is at the place of work while he or she is doing the actual work.  
Usually it is supervised by an experienced colleague or the manager. It can be the most  
useful when the individual needs to learn new task involves handling of the equipment,  
tool and facilities. This is also beneficial to resolve some of the technical errors,  
problems at work while the manager can observe the application of what has been  
taught.

**Job Secondment  
**Secondment is a temporary transfer to another department within the same or different  
organizations. This will allow individual to view their role in a wider context. All  
secondment should be well-planned and evaluated to gain maximum value from the  
experience. It is a management development tool that may be used to test potential for a  
position in a different field. Sometimes it may be used to accomplish special, short-term  
projects.  
**Job Shadowing  
**It is a means of enabling an individual to see at firsthand how a successful colleague  
operates within the organization. Individual “shadows” the colleague for a couple of  
days and follow the person’s day-to-day work life during that time. This helps  
individual to increase self-awareness of recognizing the skills they may need to develop.  
This needs specific guidelines and support from the business manager to ensure an  
effective learning experience is to be provided.  
**Action Learning- Special Projects and Assignments  
**This is a form of exercise leading to an accomplishment of definite task within a given  
time frame that is assigned by the individual’s manager. Projects help develop  
managerial skills. E.g. problem-solving, analytical techniques, communication/  
interpersonal skills, research skills, time management, report writing, presentation etc.  
The deliverable should include a report containing recommendations on a stated problem. This is normally used as executive development. Individual is allowed to access to information, people and other functions as necessary.

**Teaching as Learning  
**Teaching a subject is the best way to learn. Have an individual to research on a  
particular topic and prepare the materials to be used and the “teacher” can run it either  
as a group or do it for an individual. The Learning Champions concept in the  
organization is created for this purpose in terms of deepening the subject and gradually  
become the subject matter expert.  
**Visits/ Forums  
**This can be in the form of educational visit to institutions, other corporations, other  
offices outside home country to provide individual with first-hand experience of  
another working area such as procedures, processes and management style. This also  
provides opportunity to benchmark. The visits can stimulate individuals to participate  
in discussion and reflect on improvement strategies after the visits. It is a good  
opportunity to gain information and new ideas  
**Formal Learning- Classroom/ E-learning  
**Participating in classroom environment or go on e-learning modules would help  
individual to learn about a specific knowledge. Action plans on the application of  
learning has to take place to ensure the transfer of learning. This is particularly needed  
when there is a mandatory curriculum that an individual needs to accomplish before  
moving on to the next level of career advancement.  
**Reading and On-line research  
**This includes reading a book, going on-line to search for knowledge relevant to the  
development goal. Reading increases knowledge and googling provides instant  
information to help with task on hand. Books recommendation is available for the LF 9  
leadership competencies. They are useful for those who favor this learning style.  

## FAQ

**How does our performance being measured?  
**Our performance is measured by 2 main components, goals and competencies.

Do I have to set one goal each in the 4 perspectives?  
No, it is not necessary to have one goal in each perspective. It depends on your role.

What if my manager hasn’t set his/her goals into the system yet, how can I align?  
Suggest you set up a meeting with your manager and learn about team goals or his or her  
goals, you can then start writing yours to align.

How can I ensure my goals are S.M.A.R.T?  
Go to the goal setting e-module to learn the basics. Click the ‘wizard’ button. It is a step-bystep approach to guide you through the S.M.A.R.T criteria.

Why are we having different set of competencies for measurement?  
There are two sets of competencies namely Core and Leadership Competencies. Core  
competencies are knowledge, skills and behaviors that can apply to all or most jobs or  
specific positions in the organization. Leadership Competencies are skills, capabilities and  
behaviors that are critical to current and future role of a leader in achieving  
our strategic plans.

right development resources and you yourself carry out the plan.

Can we track back the last year performance rating from the system?  
Yes, all employees’ previous performance evaluation was stored as pdf in the system.  

**When is the deadline of goal setting and development planning?  
**There will not be a pre-set deadline (close date) in the system for these two tasks as  
colleagues can add or track progress throughout the year.

How does the performance evaluation link to incentive?  
The final rating will have linkage to the performance bonus. It reflects both goal  
achievement and how well they have demonstrated the required competencies.

My colleague joined the team less than 3 months, does she need to complete the  
year-end review? (For Manager)

and agree the goals with your team members. Then they can finalize the goals in the  
system for your approval.  

FAQ (SYSTEM)

How can I login to the system?  

What are the available support materials for Performance Management?  
You can find a list of materials in the “HOME” page.  

What can I do if I have questions about creating/ updating “Goals”?  
You can click the “RESOURCES” and “DEMO” buttons at the top of the page. If necessary, you  
can refer to the tutorials provided in the “HOME” page.

I want to view the summary of “My Goals”. I’ve clicked the icon but it doesn’t  
work. What can I do?  
Your browser may have activated the function that blocks downloading files. If you see  
below error message, click on it and select the “Download File” option. Then, click the  
icon again.

How can I update the progress of “My Goal”?  
To update the progress of a goal, click on the goal’s name (under the “Title” column). For  
each “Action” or “Target”, input the “Progress %” or “Actual” figure accordingly.

**How the overall goal progress % is determined?  
**All “Actions” and “Targets” are weighted equally. The overall goal progress % is calculated  
based on data updated for “Progress %” and “Actual” figures on pro-rata basis.  
For example, for a goal with two items having one “progress %” and one “Actual” figure to  
update; if the “progress %” is 50% (i.e. 50%) and the “Actual” figure meets the target figure  
(i.e. 100%), the overall goal progress % is 75% (deriving from 50%x50% + 50%x100%).  

**How can this button help when creating “My Goals”?  
**This “Library” button provides goal examples under the 4 main “Perspectives” – Business,  
Customer, Operation, and People. You can click the button to import an example and  
then modify it according to your situation.

After creating “Actions” and “Targets” for one “Perspective” (e.g. “Customer”), how can  
I create more for another “Perspective” (e.g. People)?  
Since you can select only one “Perspective” in each “Goal”, you need to click the  
button to create a new “Goal” in order to add “Actions” and “Targets” for  
another “Perspective”.
