## **Purpose**

For Ensuring the Quality of the Initial product output is according to buyer required standard.      

## **Scope**

Starts from Setting the required tools, Equipment, Guidelines, and Instructions in the Sewing room quality controlling workstation by the factory QC department.   

## **Responsible for process**

The output should be inspected for Construction, styling, Material, Measurements, Aesthetic, Overall workmanship & defects, very thoroughly.

Guidelines as a sample, Sample Comments, First Piece Approval, Aesthetic Standard Approvals, Approved Trim Card, Key Quality Instructions, Checking sequence, should be used for the inspection by performers of the inspection. 

While inspection finds any defects in the garment, defects should be marked by sticking a removable arrow sticker on the defective area so that the Operator can identify the defective area easily and It will be easier for the production people to rectify accordingly.

## **Procedure :**

### I**n-process inspection**

corrective/preventive action and trending operator performance will provide the factory the ability to identify problems at an early stage and to rectify quality issues before packing. 

### **MEASUREMENTS :**

Checks if the garments comply with the buyer-approved measurement chart, deviations must meet the tolerance stated on the MC.

### **WORKMANSHIP**

checks if the fabric and the workmanship is according to the buyer quality standard and according to the approved samples, Tech pack

ARTWORK : checks if the artwork complies with the approved artwork for quality, size and position

In-line inspection is also an important process to reduce costs of rework, scrap, and failed inspections. The 100% inspection operation should also require each inspector to spot-check all critical measurements periodically throughout each hour.

### **Benefits** 

In-process inspection, corrective/preventive action, and trending operator performance will provide the factory the ability to identify problems at an early stage and to rectify quality issues.

Styling, construction, and Material quality will be assured from Needle point inwards. 

Quality performance of the production will be measured so that it would give the opportunity to take action on dropped performance.
