In general, There are two type of fabrics need to inspect during fabric manufacturing.

1. Greige fabric inspection
2. Final fabric inspection

## GREIGE FABRIC INSPECTION PROCEDURE:

## **PROCESS DEFINITION:**

###  Shell Fabric inspection:

Greige fabric inspection process defined as a system of visual assessment through an inspection machine to detect and identify the knitting faults in the fabric produced by a Circular Knit Machine. 

### Collar & Cuff inspection:

Expected quality verification of Collar and Cuff fabric produced in Flat Knit Machine is called collar cuff inspection.

**PROCESS REQUIREMENTS:**

Operational Staff : Quality Inspector

Equipment: Three inspection machine

Calator (Sweden) = 02

Machine Craft = 01

### Inspection System:

1. 4 Point system
2. visual inspection

#### Safety Requirements:

To maintain operational safety following instruction has to be assured by the Supervisor.

- Operators use musk. 
- Operator must use rubber sole shoe.
- Use the tight and cotton dress.

### **INSPECTION PROCEDURE:**

#### **Inspection Plan & Execution.**

- The responsible inspection Supervisor should prepare the daily Inspection plan according to the delivery schedule and allocate the inspector with Job/ style to do the inspection.
- Responsible Quality Inspector should check the Inspection machines, tools & equipment conditions and availability and fabric produced for Inspection.

##### **INSPECTION**

- Inspection must carry on with 4 point system but has to cover 100% produced greige as per Memo: Ref. UG/ HO/ OM/ 2004/ 26, dated October28, 2004.

- A fabric roll is cut from the circular Knit machine & following information needed to put by permanent marker 

- Order number
- Quality, type
- GSM, width
- Operator’s name & Card number
- Shift
- Style
- Yarn lot, manufacturer name 
- Machine RPM
- Machine Number.

- All rolls are kept in front of the inspection machine time to time and visually inspected by the Greige Inspection Machine in a preset speed (meter / minutes) against light. For any major or minor defect like Thick & Thin, Barre mark, set off, Contamination, Fly, Oil mark, Needle line, Slub, etc. are recorded in Greige Inspection Report and classify the fabric based on points.  
- For Collar and Cuff inspection respective Machine Operator (flat knit) should conduct Inspection themselves and Inspector from Quality Dept. will audit randomly to the report and give Signature on the report as acceptance.  
- The respective Inspector should record all information (roll no, length, height, weight, color, quantity etc.) of Inspected roll in Inspection sheet Roll number should be written in the edge of fabric.
- **Point allocation for defects:**

Following Table shows the four Point Grading System for Greige Inspection at UKDL.

Point calculation according to defect sizes:

<table class="has-fixed-layout"><tbody><tr><td><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Size of Defect</strong></td><td><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Points</strong></td></tr><tr><td>3” inch or less</td><td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1</td></tr><tr><td>&gt;3 and &lt;6 inch</td><td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2</td></tr><tr><td>&gt;6 inch &lt;9 inch</td><td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3</td></tr><tr><td>&gt;9 inch</td><td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 4</td></tr></tbody></table>

Fabric defects point calculation

###### **Grading System:**

Up to 10 points = Grade A

Up to 10-20 points= Grade B

Up to 20-30 points = grade C

Above 30 points = rejected 7 subject to decision.

- GSM of greige after 3rd wash must be checked in QC lab, report of which to be attached. (Ref. UG/ HO/ OM/2004/26, dated October 28, 2004).
-  Stitch length before wash to be mentioned as well on the report. (Ref. UG/ HO/ OM/ 2004/ 26, dated October28, 2004).
- After 200kg production, the Greige must be inspected by the Central Quality Audit team for approval to go ahead with bulk production. (Ref. UG/ PIRM/ SOP/ 007/ 14, date 9th December2014).

###### **Knitting Fault** 

Major defects, reason of defects and solution are given below:

<table><tbody><tr><td>Sl. No</td><td>Defects</td><td>Reason</td><td>Solution</td></tr><tr><td>1.</td><td>Slubs</td><td>Caused in Spinning mills being spun into the yarn in the spinning process</td><td>Yarn must be inspected before production so that there is no uneven issue.</td></tr><tr><td>2.</td><td>Neps</td><td>It looks like a peeling of the yarn which density is more than original fabric. Usually this is found in fleece fabric due to excess feed%.&nbsp;</td><td>Yarn must be inspected before production and the percentage of feed and percentage of take up must be equal.</td></tr><tr><td>3.</td><td>Thick &amp; Thin</td><td>Usually caused in spinning process for which yarn gets uneven. Thick yarn is 50% greater than normal yarn and thin is 50% less than normal yarn.</td><td>Use defect-less yarn.</td></tr><tr><td>4.</td><td>Hairiness</td><td>Fibers come out from Yarn called hairiness.</td><td>Yarn must be checked before production.</td></tr><tr><td>5.</td><td>Hole</td><td>It is a common problem in Knitting process. The main reason is defective and broken Needle. Also occurs due to yarn less strength.&nbsp;</td><td>Yarn tension must be corrected and remove defective yarn.</td></tr><tr><td>6.</td><td>Yarn Contamination</td><td>Various materials coming from cotton is mixed at the time of yarn production.</td><td>Yarn must be inspected before production.</td></tr><tr><td>7.</td><td>Fly Yarn</td><td>This is happened for the friction of different parts of Knitting machine.&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Minimize the friction point as much as possible in Knitting machine.&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>8.</td><td>Barre Mark/Stripe</td><td>This problem is occurred for Cylinder labeling and inappropriate yarn tension.</td><td>Put correct tension during Knitting process and level the cylinder.</td></tr><tr><td>9.</td><td>Needle Line</td><td>For defective needle or Grooves or inaccurate Cylinder Needle may occur.&nbsp;</td><td>Clean machine Grooves and remove defective yarns.</td></tr><tr><td>10.</td><td>Sinker Mark</td><td>If Knitting Sinker shrink or due to movement of sinker.

## Final Fabric Inspection

### **Equipment**

- **Inspection Frame:** The frame should be equipped with a variable speed drive, a yard counter, a under carriage light to see through the construction and an overhead light to inspect the face of the fabric.
- **Inspection Speed:** The frame should be capable of running up to 30 yards per minute and should have both forward and reverse controls.
- **Viewing distance:** The inspection should be performed from an observation distance of 2 to 4 feet so as to get full vision of the fabric width.
- **Lighting:** Overhead cool white florescent (CWF) lighting is recommended for the inspection. The surface illumination level s should be a minimum of 1000 lux.

2. **Light Box & Color**

- Each factory should have an international light box equipped with:

- **Light Source                                                     Light Type**

### **LAB-DIP PROCEDURE:**

- Approved Lab dip from buyer / Merchandising 
- Required quality parameters sheet for fabric from buyers end.
- Physical color swatch for Lab dip must be 3”x 3” size for reference. 
- Lab dip must produce 4 pcs each 4.5”x 4.5” size.
- A copy of Delta ‘E’ & visual ‘E’ report send to the Quality Lab for their reference.  

### **Fabric Shade Check:**

1. In Application lab there are lights available in the Light box are light TV85, D65, and UV3000 etc. to check the fabric shade. 
2. Batch to batch shade, running; shade in a batch should be check during visually using light box by the inspector during dyeing production.
3. Each and every visual report should be submitted to the Head of Quality and Unit Head as well for their decision.

#### Procedure:

- **Color Standard:** Check the head end sample in the light box against the fabric reference sample under D65 and TL84 light source whichever available. This should be done once for each color inspected.

![Shade checking using light box](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/TxXkDmISI738aFU6oRvruZgTeGmuldPTu8KVV3Dfd6RgFNIBv72sOqZnqv9l1lEgz18hJET41xgFwCMD-NTV8GPUsLOShzCz52zUz2aiXQQGsaP3mJ_xq_QakyEy-_Jebw)

- **Shading within the roll:** Check for shading at the beginning, in the middle and at  the end of each roll inspected, using the dead-end sample for comparison

\* Side to center

\* Side to side

\* End to end

- **Color continuity Card:** Check for color consistency between the rolls. Cut a small sample (about 2x2inches) from the left side, the center and the right side of each inspected roll and attached to the color continuity card. Check the sample against the fabric reference sample. Note any significant variation of shade from roll to roll.

![Shade continuity card](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/QQF7NSL2u_SJ9XwPg91mH3hFkQgC4-sBC32SxLzirV6w2-8obKwyW-m06GCC9CnrqmBrVaPxNdG-XBFXVgEf4n9u4slXREYOtTvjdWmXJ_rfm8jvFGYSb4doxdeS88Glgw)

- **Fabric Width:** Measure the cut able width at the beginning, in the middle, and at the end of every roll. If a variation in cut able width is found, the factory will determine if the fabric is usable and if a replacement is necessary. At this point, the inspector should also check the condition of the selvedge. The selvedges should lay flat, be free of tension, and should not have a tendency to curl.

![Fabric width measure](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/2e4vCTHvBcJuIQQSQoSRCYhS2th1kE972oWjLJDrynd6oiT9gJt72oQmdrZoh1VtkDi09L8AW3gRXFjhkWz836V8GUOXqWWDiubDYvBRCJNQGvtZku7I94FD10TjY-c0SQ)

- **Roll Length:** Measure and record the length of each roll inspected.

- **Inspection of Defects**

         Start the frame and inspect for defects. Run the frame at 20 + 5 yards per minute. If a defect is   observed: 

1. Classify the defect and assign the appropriate points based on the severity of the defect. The severity is determined by the type and the length of the defect. 
2. Mark the defect at the selvage and/or at the defect.
3. Record the defect and the assigned points on the inspection worksheet.

6. **4 point Inspection System :**

The 4 Point System is named form a basic grading rule: regardless of length/size or number of defects, no more than 4 penalty points may be assigned on any linear meter/yard.

**Defects and Penalty Points**

Defects should be marked with a colored sticker. To show defect position the selvage should be marked with the same color of sticker or thread.

Defects in both warp/weft directions will be assigned points using the following criteria: 

<table><tbody><tr><td>Defect length</td><td>Points</td><td>Sticker color</td></tr><tr><td>Less than 3″</td><td>1</td><td>White</td></tr><tr><td>3″ - 6″</td><td>2</td><td>Green</td></tr><tr><td>6″ - 9″</td><td>3</td><td>Yellow</td></tr><tr><td>Over 9″</td><td>4</td><td>Red</td></tr></tbody></table>

Fabric defect point system

10. FABRIC FLAGGING WITH STICKER

After visual inspection fabric flagging with stickers is done as follows:

- Large 4 – point major faults in either length or width wise should be flagged with arrow marked sticker in the right hand side of the fabric.
- More than 2 – point defects should be flagged. 
- Holes, Stains and soils should be flagged.
- Flags should be clearly visible when the fabric is spread face up or face down.
- Flags should not be detached from the fabric during transportation and handling by any means. 

11. SPLICING 

The rolls can be composed of maximum two splices and the minimum length of each splice should not be less than 20 meter.

12. BOWS, BIAS AND SKEWS 

Up to 100 cm width of fabric, a maximum of 2 cm bows, bias or skew is acceptable. 

13. ACCEPTANCE

Generally any piece of fabric with less than 20 points fault per 100 square yard is allowed to pass however for a roll; the average value should not exceed 40 points per 100 square yard. **More than 40 points fault per 100 square yard is recorded as reject.**

14. REJECTION

Fabric is rejected in case of the followings:

- Any roll having a running or repeating defect through more than three continuous meters shall be rejected regardless of point count. 
- Big tear is rejected. 
- Dark crease is rejected.
- Fabric with more than 1″ short in width is rejected. If the shrinkage is within the range, the fabric should be returned to finishing department for correction of width.

15.  MACHINE & AREA CLEANING

The inspector is responsible for maintaining the overall cleanliness of the Nazer Inspection machine so that the fabric remains clean during the inspection process. 

The Maintenance department performs machine maintenance as per the PM Schedule. Refer to the Maintenance Specification (Document No. 31-101) for details.

Cleaner cleans the floor several times a day or whenever necessary.

If dyeing machine keep in open air in a long time not clean the oil since Dyeing.

- Dirty Spot:
- If Fabric kept in open air and dirty or dust is laid in Fabric.
- Uneven Shade:

If color, Caustic soda are not melted properly.

The dosing time of color and soda is minimum.

- **Hand Feel:**

If the Softener is not work properly.

- **Strength Less:**

If the Chemical Enzyme is used more than acceptance limit. 

If not deactivated the action of Enzyme and kept the fabric in wet condition.

Recap the striping , strength length occur.

- **Roll to Roll Shade Variation:**

Since preparing of Batch different roll of fabric is assembled then it is occur.

- **Fabric Damage:**

If maximum Chemical Enzyme is used or maximum striping in time of dyeing this is occur.  

- **Color Bleeding:**

When soaping if fabric not rinse properly color bleeding occur.

- **Rub Mark:**

When dyeing if grazed the fabric repeatedly through different parts of machine, Rub mark occur.

- **Soda Spot:**

Deactivation of Soda is not right this is occurring. 

- Dyeing Crease:

1. Anti-creasing agent of chemical is use minimum.
2. If loading temperature is maximum.
3. If temperature increase directly. 

-  **Yellow Spot:**

If the white fabric is kept in open air in wet condition this is occur.

### **Finishing Fault**

<table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Defect Name</strong></td><td><strong>Reason of Defect</strong></td><td><strong>Solution</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Finishing Crease Mark</strong></td><td>In time of finishing a wrinkle or bent is laid in fabric.When unload from dyeing machine fabric left in a position for a long time then crease mark occurred.If water absorption is occur in Hydrostactor Machine for a long time then it happened.&nbsp;Spreader or Shape is not set in Padder in required Dia crease mark will occur.&nbsp;Width of fabric is not accurate in stanter Machine&nbsp;</td><td>Check all these are set in accurate measurement.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Dirty Spot</strong></td><td>It may occur from Dust and dirty of finishing floor.&nbsp;Dirty comes from the carrying trolley.If the surface of machine is not clean that dust or dirt is laid in fabric.</td><td>Always clean finishing floor.Clean the trolley properly before carrying fabric.Clean machine surface before production.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Water Spot</strong></td><td>During fabric drying if temperature not gives equally all over the fabric than occur.Water may come from steam source of compactor machine.</td><td>During drying temperature should be equal in all over.Observe the compactor machine so that water not arises from steam source.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Rust Stain</strong></td><td>If any stain of Metal Oxidation laid in fabric that is called Rust Stain.If Oxidization is occurring in metal trolley and wet fabric kept in that trolley than Rust stain happened.&nbsp;If any machine is Idle for a long time but run production that will be occur.If any machines repairs but not clean properly then rust stain occurs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Clean trolley properly before Keep fabric in trolley.Clean all parts of machine before production.&nbsp;After repairing machine clean properly.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Wrong Slitting</strong></td><td>Provide a Drop Needle in the fabric for open width but if the cutting is not done according to that needle line this problem arise.For unconscious and unskilled of operator.</td><td>Slitting must be done by skilled operator.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Lycra Damage&nbsp;</strong></td><td>If heat-seal is done more than required temperature Lycra yarn burnt and cause Lycra damage.During heat is set in stenter if speed is less than standard this is occur.During Machine running, suddenly stopped then Lycra damage will be occur.&nbsp;</td><td>Check the temperature of Stenter Machine is right or wrong.The Speed of Stenter Machine should be accurate.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Bowing Mark</strong></td><td>If the fabric is come uneven, twisted or Curly from the Compactor machine called Bowing Mark.&nbsp;If the setting of Compactor Machine (Overfeed, Compaction, Pressure, Tension) are not equal in every place bowing will be occur.If operate the Machine by unskilled operator.&nbsp;</td><td>If Bowing Mark occurs fabric set in Machine by the opposite direction so that Bowing Mark will be removed.Operate Machine by the skilled operator.&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Softener Stain&nbsp;</strong></td><td>If chemical of softener is not mixed properly.If Softener is used more than required.&nbsp;</td><td>Mixing softener accurately and use as required.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Hole</strong></td><td>Hole may be occurring for the scrubbed with various parts (pin of chain or broken parts of machine) and fabric.If the chain of Stenter Machine is run in the middle of the fabric either selvedge of fabric, it happens.&nbsp;</td><td>Operator must check the position of chain.Observe fabric is not rub with broken parts of machine.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Wheel Mark</strong></td><td>If the pressure of Padder is high it is happenIf the wheel of Slitting Machine not run properly.</td><td>During De-water pressure of Padder set accurately.Observed the wheel of Slitting machine is right or not.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Grease Spot</strong></td><td>Grease oil is used in various parts of Machine like bearing, Gear box.
